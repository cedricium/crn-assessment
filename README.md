Assessment submission for: Cedric Amaya

## Getting Started

This project has been configured using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

**Install Dependencies**

In the root directory, run

```sh
npm install
# OR
yarn install
```

**Run the Application**

Next, start the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# OR
yarn run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to /api/\*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages. API routes can be accessed on `/api/<path>`, e.g. http://localhost:3000/api/shifts or http://localhost:3000/api/nurses.
